dotfiles
========

My dotfiles for neovim, tmux and everything else.

Locally, I store all my dotfiles in `~/.dotfiles` and then symlink the relevant files. 
My motivation for doing this is to separate out my own changing dotfiles from my home directory.

To be used at your own risk!

## Installation instructions
TODO Write instructions to install global packages and tricky steps like
`ln -s ~/Workspace/dotfiles/coc-settings.json ~/.config/nvim/coc-settings.json`
